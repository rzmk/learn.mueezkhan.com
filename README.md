## Details

This is the code repository for [https://learn.mueezkhan.com](https://learn.mueezkhan.com).

Built with [Nextra](https://nextra.site) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, so feel free to [make a new issue](https://github.com/rzmk/learn.mueezkhan.com/issues) or [a pull request](https://github.com/rzmk/learn.mueezkhan.com/pulls).

### Nextra Docs

I recommend referencing [the Nextra docs](https://nextra.site/docs) to help understand the codebase.

### Prettier plugin for Tailwind CSS

The project uses Prettier with [the Prettier plugin for Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) which automatically sorts classes based on a recommended class order. Install it as a dev dependency as mentioned in the docs:

```bash
npm install -D prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
```

### Gitmoji

The repository follows [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) commit conventions. For ease of use [read the `gitmoji-cli` README.md](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli#readme).

When merging a PR, make sure to include gitmoji's convention of using `:twisted_rightwards_arrows:` :twisted_rightwards_arrows: as its intention.

### About Tailwind CSS in MDX

Note that it's not easy using Tailwind CSS styles in .mdx files, so I suggest making React components for them.
